- [ ] add the ability for commands to be turned on/off
- [ ] Update system on different problems the bot is currently experiencing
- [ ] Create a web site for oauth with listed tasks and dashboard for configuring, plus documentation
- [ ] Use Pal Pal's/Stripe's API to create an donate reward system (may not be possible due to identifying)
- [ ] Content Creator Reward System Based on how many subs/videos/viwers/etc someone has (Need OAuth For This Sadly :/)
